Line 1: an integer variabled called x is declared and initialized to 7
Line 2: a pointer to an integer called ptr is declared, and is initialized to the 
        address of x
Line 3: the value stored in the memory location pointed to by ptr has three added to it,
        and is then stored in the memory location pointed to by ptr.
        Thus, the value of x is now 10
Line 4: the value of x is printed to the screen (the output will be 10)
