/* The way that C works is that when one uses the #include pre-processor
 * directive, the specified header file actually gets 'included' in the C
 * code prior to compilation.  
 * 
 * These header files just contain the *definitions* of the methods/functions:
 * what kind of variable(s) the function returns, and the format of the
 * arguments to the functions.  One can think of these header files as a
 * sort of API for the functions in the library.
 * 
 * The actual *code* for the functions is contained
 * in a separate (binary) library file that is linked with the object file(s)
 * for user code at linking time.
 * 
 * It works the same way for user-defined packages/libraries.  One can include
 * the header file for the user library, and then link to the (binary) user 
 * library at linking time.

/* C also allows composite data types ... extremely useful! 
 
 We will define it here, before any of our functions, so that
 they all will know what it means
 
 BTW, it is this struct composite data type that is at the heart of all
 object oriented programming!!! We will see this again in C++ 
 
 Very simply, in our example, cartesianVector is a class with three (public)
 member fields (x,y, and z).  Later in the code, we will instantiate objects
 of this class.

                        for the sign of positive numbers
     
    Followed by
􏰀           - a number that specifies the minimum field width
