Line 1: an integer variabled called i is declared and initialized to 8.
Line 2: a pointer to an integer called p is declared, and is initialized to the 
        address of i (i.e. p points to i).
Line 3: the value stored in the memory location pointed to by p (i.e. *p) is 
        multiplied by 2, and is then this value (i.e. 16) is stored in the memory 
        location pointed to by p.  Since p points to i, the value of i is now 16.
Line 4: the value of i is printed to the screen (the output will be 16).
